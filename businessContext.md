🛡️ AuraLink AI Security - Master Business & Architecture Plan

Founder: Iran Trinidad | Domain: auralink.live | Origin: Guatemala (Global Target)

1. The Concept (The Pitch)

AuraLink is not a traditional consultancy. It is an AI-powered Offensive and Defensive Cybersecurity firm. 
While competitors are stuck manually reviewing logs, AuraLink leverages predictive algorithms to stop threats before they happen.

Motto: "Security that thinks faster than hackers."

2. Business Model & Monetization (Prices in USD)

The high-end corporate market (Banks, Fintechs, Call Centers, Law Firms) pays a premium for security. Our advantage is AI-driven automation, which maintains high profit margins.

A. Recurring Services (SaaS / Retainer) - Cash Flow
These are monthly contracts where AI monitors 24/7.

| Service | AI-Powered Description | Suggested Price (Monthly) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SME Shield (Basic)** | Endpoint monitoring, Managed Next-Gen Antivirus, automated weekly vulnerability scanning. | $350 - $500 |
| **Aura Sentinel (Pro)** | All of the above + Cloud SIEM with AI anomaly detection + 8/5 Support + Anti-Phishing training. | $850 - $1,200 |
| **CISO as a Service (Ent)** | All of the above + 24/7 Incident Response + Compliance Audits (ISO 27001) + Strategy led by Iran Trinidad. | $2,500+ |

B. "One-Off" Services (Project Based) - Capital Injection

*   **AI-Driven Black Box Pentesting ($1,500 - $4,500):** 
    We use proprietary AI scripts to simulate massive brute force and SQL Injection attacks, followed by expert manual validation.
*   **Post-Incident Forensic Analysis ($150/hour or flat $3,000 fee):** 
    Emergency cleanup and recovery for compromised systems (Ransomware/Data Breaches).
*   **"Human Firewall" Training ($800 per session):** 
    Interactive workshops for employees on detecting social engineering.

3. Legal & Operational Structure

*   **Entity:** A "Sociedad Anónima" (S.A. / Corporation) is recommended for corporate credibility. Financial institutions and large firms rarely hire individual contractors for security.
*   **Tax/Compliance:** Register as an exporter of services for international clients. Ensure local compliance with standard VAT/ISR regulations.
*   **Ironclad Contracts:** Requires strict NDAs (Non-Disclosure Agreements) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with liability disclaimers if clients ignore security recommendations.

4. Website Architecture (auralink.live)

We are building a high-performance, secure framework.

*   **Frontend:** Astro 4.0 + React (Islands). (Speed & SEO).
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Modern "Hacker-Style" Dark Mode).
*   **Hosting:** Vercel (Automated CI/CD).
*   **Backend/API:** Python (FastAPI) for live AI demo integrations.
*   **CMS:** Sanity.io (For the "Threat Intelligence" blog).

5. Go-to-Market Strategy

*   **LinkedIn Authority:** Daily posts on "The state of global cybersecurity" and AI-driven defense.
*   **The "Hook" (Lead Magnet):** Offer a Free External Vulnerability Scan on the web. The report is generated by a wrapper script. Once vulnerabilities are exposed, the client hires us to fix them.
*   **Networking:** Presenting as "The AI-Cybersecurity Expert" at industry events.

6. Initial Technical Setup

*   **Workstation:** Kali Linux (Dedicated environment) for security audits.
*   **Cloud:** AWS/Azure for C2 (Command & Control) servers and tool hosting.
*   **Tools:** Burp Suite Pro, Nessus, and custom Python scripts.
